// Data Structures //

Merkle (Hash) Trees
> Internal nodes labeled with the hash of its children's labels
> Leaf nodes labeled with the hash of corresponding data
> Top (Master) hash acquired from a trusted source, used to verify hash trees from non-trusted sources

Radix Trees
> Space-optimized tries: Only children nodes are merged with their parents
> PATRIDITA Tree: radix = 2, Each bit of the key is compared individually, binary tree
